This is the eye tracking tool to be used for the Psych Department in diagnosing ADHD with objective data.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  The Psychology Department at Fresno State has been conducting a study utilizing a mixed reality simulation to find a way to diagnose ADHD using objective data, as opposed to subjective data.

<p>
  The test subjects are in a room consisting of walls painted green and a desk. They put on a Varjo XR-4 headset and a set of headphones. Once the simulation starts, the test subject is inside a classroom and sits through a 20-25 minute lecture on ethics.
